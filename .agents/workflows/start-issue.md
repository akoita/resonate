description: Start working on a GitHub issue — create branch, track work, open PR

# Start Issue Workflow

When the user says "start issue #N", "work on #N", or references working on a specific GitHub issue, follow these steps:

> **Polish bursts:** For a sequence of small UI/UX, copy, CSS, or workflow
> refinements around the same feature, reuse the current feature branch and PR.
> Do not create a new branch/PR for each small follow-up unless the user asks
> for a clean split. Keep iterating on the same branch until the user says
> `finish` or `merge`.

## 1. Read the issue

- Fetch the issue details from GitHub using `issue_read` (owner: `akoita`, repo: `resonate`)
- Understand the acceptance criteria and scope

## 2. Create a feature branch

// turbo

- Branch naming convention: `feat/<issue-number>-<short-kebab-description>`
  - Example: `feat/278-stem-pricing-dashboard`
  - For bugs: `fix/<issue-number>-<short-kebab-description>`
- Create the branch from `main` using: `git checkout -b feat/<issue-number>-<short-description>`
- Verify you're on the new branch: `git branch --show-current`

## 3. Update the issue

- Add a comment on the issue: "🚧 Work started on branch `feat/<issue-number>-...`"
- If not already labeled, add the `In Progress` label

## 4. Plan the work

- Create an implementation plan artifact
- Request user review before coding

## 5. Commit conventions

- All commits on the branch should reference the issue: `feat(#N): description` or `fix(#N): description`
- Make atomic commits — one logical change per commit

## 6. When work is complete

- Push the branch
- Open a Pull Request targeting `main` with:
  - Title: same as branch purpose, referencing the issue
  - Body: summary of changes + `Closes #N`
  - Link back to the issue
- Request user review
- Do not immediately merge or clean up branches from this workflow. Merging is
  controlled by the finish workflow and requires an explicit user `merge`
  request.

## Important rules

- **NEVER commit or push before user approval** — always ask first
- **NEVER commit directly to `main`** — always use a feature branch
- **ALWAYS check current branch** before starting work with `git branch --show-current`
- If already on a feature branch for the issue, continue working there — don't create a new one
- If on a different branch, stash or commit current work before switching
