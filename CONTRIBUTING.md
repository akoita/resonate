# Contributing

> **Note**: This is a personal learning project and I'm not actively accepting contributions at this time. Feel free to explore the codebase, fork it, or open issues for discussion, but please don't expect PR reviews or merges.

If this changes in the future, I'll update this document.

## For Reference

If you're exploring the codebase, here's how it's organized:

- **`backend/`** — NestJS API with Prisma
- **`web/`** — Next.js frontend
- **`contracts/`** — Solidity smart contracts (Foundry)
- **`docs/`** — Project specifications and guides
