## Custom Skill Opportunities

Gaps where we could create project-specific skills or contribute back:

1. **Solidity/Foundry testing** — A skill for running `forge test` with pattern-based analysis of failures
2. **NestJS module scaffolding** — Generate NestJS modules/services following our conventions from `AGENTS.md`
3. **Prisma migration checker** — Validate schema changes and generate migration scripts
4. **Account abstraction patterns** — Codify our passkey-first AA patterns for consistent implementation
