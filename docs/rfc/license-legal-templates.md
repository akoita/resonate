# License Legal Template Library

Standard covenant templates for each license type on the Resonate protocol. These templates are stored on IPFS and linked to License NFTs via the `covenants` field in the metadata.

## Template Storage

All legal templates are stored on IPFS as markdown or PDF documents. The CID is referenced in the License NFT `covenants` array.

```
ipfs://Qm.../resonate-personal-streaming-v1.md
ipfs://Qm.../resonate-remix-license-v1.md
ipfs://Qm.../resonate-commercial-license-v1.md
ipfs://Qm.../resonate-sync-license-v1.md
ipfs://Qm.../resonate-sample-license-v1.md
ipfs://Qm.../resonate-broadcast-license-v1.md
```

Templates are versioned. New versions are minted as new CIDs; existing licenses retain their original covenant CIDs.
